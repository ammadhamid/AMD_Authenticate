✅ Authify Features Summary
You're building:

✅ Next.js frontend

✅ Express.js backend

✅ MongoDB for data

✅ NextAuth.js for auth (OAuth + email/password)

✅ MFA with speakeasy

✅ Email verification with nodemailer

✅ Secure cookies & CSRF protection

🧩 Implementation Flow (High-Level Strategy)
Let’s divide this into chunks. Each chunk should be testable and shippable. You don’t want to mix OAuth, MFA, and CSRF all in one go. That leads to debugging nightmares.

1️⃣ Set up NextAuth.js with OAuth
Start simple: GitHub/Google OAuth. No MFA, no CSRF yet.

Are you using NextAuth in pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts or /app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts?

Does the OAuth flow complete and return a session?

Are cookies being set by NextAuth?

🧠 Ask yourself:

What provider are you testing with first?

What data is being returned from the provider?

Is the session stored in a JWT or a database?

📚 Docs:

NextAuth OAuth Guide

NextAuth JWT Session

2️⃣ Add MongoDB Adapter for persistent users
You need this before doing email verification or MFA.

Have you connected MongoDB to NextAuth with @next-auth/mongodb-adapter?

Does the user get saved after first sign-in?

Can you see your users and accounts collections?

📚 Docs:

MongoDB Adapter Docs

3️⃣ Implement Email Verification with nodemailer
Use a custom Next.js API route like /api/auth/verify — not built into NextAuth by default.

Do you send a tokenized verification link to the user's email?

Do you hash and store the token in the DB with expiry?

Can you handle clicking the email to verify?

🧠 Debug Flow:

Log every email content in dev to inspect the token.

What happens when the user clicks the link?

How do you mark the user as "verified" in the DB?

Nodemailer Docs

4️⃣ Enable Multifactor Auth (MFA) via speakeasy
This is custom, not built into NextAuth. You’ll handle it post-login.

Are you generating a TOTP secret and storing it per user?

Are you using QR codes for users to scan in Google Authenticator?

Do you verify TOTP codes on login?

🧠 Ask yourself:

Where in the login flow are you asking for the 2FA code?

Is there a way to “remember” trusted devices?

Are you storing MFA secret securely (e.g., encrypted)?

📚 Docs:

Speakeasy GitHub

StackOverflow: "speakeasy implement 2fa next.js"

5️⃣ Add CSRF + secure cookie session
You’ll probably want CSRF for any custom Express routes — NextAuth handles CSRF internally.

Do your Express routes use csurf middleware?

Are your cookies set with httpOnly, secure, and SameSite=strict?

🧠 Ask:

Are you using proxy (e.g. Vercel + backend on Railway)? Then cookies need secure: true with sameSite: 'none'.

📚 Docs:

csurf npm

Cookie security flags
